        ## History
        CaseDB started when me and my fiance (now wife) were talking
        about famous serial killers (we're Crime Scene / Digital
        Forensics graduates, we do that sometimes). At some point in
        the future we're hoping to create a book on some of the most
        interesting cases. Until that time I'm hoping this will be a
        useful research tool as well as a pretty cool catalogue in
        itself.
